# Second_Year_Data_Structures_Assignment
University second year assignment to create an application to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions.

The aim of this assignment was to create an application to convert infix expressions to postfix notation. Using java, we were tasked to develop this application using either a queue or stack abstract data type, built from the ground up using either a linked list or array list. Use of the built-in data structures from the java libraries for the queue and stack were not permitted.
Dijkstraâ€™s Shunting Yard Algorithm was used as a basis for the infix to postfix conversion, the FIFO operations used in this algorithm dictated the use of the stack data type which was implemented using the array list.

A executable jar file is included in this repository, although it should be noted that this is currently just a console application.
